        I love playing music. In the last couple of years I have really
        dived head first into learning Irish music. I got the introductory
        insturment, the tin whistle, and moved onto learning the flute
        as well. Such fun music and people.
        <br><br>
        I have started to put together a tune book to write down the tunes
        that I know, how I play them, and resources I have found useful in learning
        and playing the music.
        <br><br>
        Hope you find it useful as well.
